    Instructions: All measurements from lower left corner of PCB to lower left
    corner of component or opening, holes measured to center. All measurements in mm. 
    PCB orientation is long side of board along the x axis.
    Bottom components measured from top left corner to top left corner
    of component or opening with the PCB rotated around the x axis.
